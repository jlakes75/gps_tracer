The most commonly used data types used in creating databases are "String", "Boolean", "Intger", " Float",  "Array"
and "Object Hash"

String data types represent charcters and denoted in " " String = "hi"

Boolean data types represent variables that or either true or false or 1 or 0 

Intger data types represent values denoted by Intger = k or Intger = 96

Float data types  represent 

Array data types  represent A set length and ordered collection of elements

The difference between data and information is that data is facts and figures and bits of information but not information itself
When data is processed, interpreted, organized, structured and presented to make meaningful use it is then information.

 The following are Databases relationsips: Belongs- to, has- many, one-to one, many-many 
 Belongs-to relationsips exsists when there is a one - one relationship but one object has the primary key and the other has the
 foriegn key 

Has- many relationships exisits when there is 1:n or n:n relationships. Using the 1:n relationship we are looking at 
a single object for example car and parking garages. A parking garage and many cars parked it(the primary object has many 
secondary objects)  

One - one relationship exisits when one row in the database links to only one row in another datbase for exapmle husband and wife

Many - Many relationships exsists when data entries can have multiple relationships for exapmle books and authors.
Books can be written by many authors and authors can write many books.
